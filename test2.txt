Given 9 unique unsorted integers from 0 to 9 inclusive, find the missing integer

        [0, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

    Given N from 0 to N? ((0, 1, 3, 4), 4)

    multiple missing integers (1, 2, 4), 4

    min to max, so (-3, -1, 0, 1, 2) , -3, 3

    I don't tell you min and max, you get them from the inputs, so (-3, -1, 0, 1, 2)
